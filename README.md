THIS is a practice problem given at end of week4 at DigitalCrafts... 

"Write a function called sumZero which accepts an array of integers. The 
function should find the first pair where the sum is 0. Return an array that 
includes both values that sum to zero or undefined if a pair does not exsist.
 

[11,30,-1,4,3,9,-2,-1,0,-3,8,4,5,6,-6] = [-3, 3]

 

 

Questions:

 

What is the big(O) of your solution?

 

 

What if the array WAS SORTED?



[-6,-3,-2,-1,0,3,4,5,8,9] = [-3, 3]
